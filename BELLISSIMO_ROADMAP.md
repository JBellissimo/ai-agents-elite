# Bellissimo AI Labs — Company Roadmap

> *Build the highest-profit-per-person AI services firm in the world.*
> One operator. Elite infrastructure. Unlimited leverage.

---

## The Model

```
YOU (JB) — Relationship + Sales + Vision
     ↓
BELLISSIMO AI LABS — Legal entity, brand, product delivery
     ↓
AGENTS + SKILLS — Do the work at scale
     ↓
CLIENTS — Pay for outcomes, not hours
```

**Two tracks. One intake.**

| SustainCFO Track | Bellissimo AI Labs Track |
|---|---|
| Fractional CFO ($3K–$10K/mo) | AI Skills + Agent Packages |
| Financial visibility, cash flow, margin | Company OS, automation, dashboards |
| Existing CFO relationships | New AI-curious market |

**Universal entry point:** The Bellissimo Reveal (CEO interview → AI report → over-deliver)

---

## Phase 1 — Legal & Infrastructure
*Make it real. Make it fast.*

- [ ] Register Wyoming LLC: **Bellissimo AI Labs LLC**
- [ ] Open Mercury Bank business account
- [ ] Secure domain: `bellissimo.ai` or `bellissimoailabs.com`
- [ ] Set up business email (Google Workspace)
- [ ] Create Stripe account for payments
- [ ] File for EIN (IRS, free, ~10 min online)
- [ ] Draft simple service agreement template (1-page, AI-assisted)
- [ ] Set up basic bookkeeping (Wave or QuickBooks Simple)

**Done when:** You can legally invoice a client and get paid.

---

## Phase 2 — Core Product: The Bellissimo Reveal
*The universal entry point. Sell this first.*

- [ ] Design the CEO Interview flow (warm podcast-host AI persona)
- [ ] Build async intake: web form or voice-to-text → structured data
- [ ] Set intake behind sign-in on the Bellissimo website
- [ ] Build `ceo_interview_agent.py` — processes intake → generates report
- [ ] Design the Reveal report template (2-page, PDF-ready)
- [ ] Define the over-delivery package (report + 3 action items + industry benchmarks)
- [ ] Price it: $0 intro OR $500 paid product (test both)
- [ ] Run 3 beta clients through the flow (SustainCFO referrals)

**Done when:** A CEO fills out the intake, you review the AI output, and you deliver a Reveal within 48 hours.

---

## Phase 3 — Website
*Sophisticated, light, fast. Built to convert.*

- [ ] Choose stack: Webflow (fastest) or Next.js (most control)
- [ ] Design aesthetic: Light/cream background, navy + warm accent, JetBrains Mono headers
- [ ] Home: The one-line pitch + "Request Your Reveal" CTA
- [ ] About: The philosophy (craft, leverage, AI-first)
- [ ] Products page: The Reveal, The OS, The Flywheel
- [ ] Sign-in portal: CEO interview intake lives here
- [ ] Blog/intelligence feed (optional — AI-generated thought leadership)
- [ ] Deploy: Vercel or Netlify

**Aesthetic reference:** agent-flywheel.com structure — but light, warm, premium (not dark/dev-heavy)

**Done when:** "Request Your Reveal" form is live and connected to the agent pipeline.

---

## Phase 4 — The Company OS Product
*Sell the brain, not the hours.*

**What it is:** A custom Claude setup (Skills + MCP tools) that acts as an AI Chief of Staff for a specific company. Built once, templated, sold to similar companies.

- [ ] Define the OS stack: Claude + custom Skills + MCP servers
- [ ] Build v1 for one pilot client (document everything)
- [ ] Extract the template: what's universal vs. what's client-specific
- [ ] Price the OS: $5K–$15K setup + $1K–$3K/mo retainer
- [ ] Build a second OS for a similar company at 70% of the first price
- [ ] The pattern: each client makes the next one cheaper to build

**Skills to package first:**
- Financial Red Flag Detector (SustainCFO)
- Meeting Prep Agent (EOS/Traction style)
- Client Intelligence Brief (CRM-style)
- Proposal Generator
- Weekly Ops Digest

**Done when:** You have 2 OS clients and a replicable playbook.

---

## Phase 5 — The Flywheel Product
*This is the sellable system, not just the service.*

**What it is:** A documented, productized agent flywheel that compounds — each new data point makes the system smarter. Sell the flywheel architecture to companies that want to build their own.

- [ ] Define the Flywheel framework (intake → agent → output → feedback → improve)
- [ ] Package it as a workshop: "Build Your Company Flywheel" ($2K–$5K half-day)
- [ ] Build the Flywheel diagram (visual, client-facing)
- [ ] Create Flywheel case studies from OS clients
- [ ] License the Flywheel playbook to other consultants (franchise model, Phase 6+)

**The pitch:** *"We don't just use AI. We build you a system that gets smarter every time it runs."*

**Done when:** You've run one Flywheel workshop and have a case study.

---

## Phase 6 — Scale & Distribution
*Leverage the infrastructure you've built.*

- [ ] Guerrilla marketing campaign: stylized building photos → "Bellissimo AI Labs sees your business differently"
- [ ] Email intelligence campaign: shallow reports to cold prospects → upgrade CTA
- [ ] Build referral network: accountants, attorneys, business brokers who refer clients
- [ ] Target verticals: white-collar first (law firms, medical practices, financial services, agencies), then expand
- [ ] Explore franchise/rep model: others sell Bellissimo services in their markets
- [ ] Hire first contractor (prompt engineer or developer) when revenue justifies

**Done when:** You have inbound leads you didn't personally source.

---

## SustainCFO Integration
*Keep this engine running while building Bellissimo.*

- [ ] Package SustainCFO as a Bellissimo service tier
- [ ] Use SustainCFO clients as beta testers for the Reveal and OS products
- [ ] Build the Financial X-Ray agent to deliver CFO-grade output (already started)
- [ ] Automate monthly reporting so SustainCFO clients require less of your time
- [ ] Target: SustainCFO runs on 50% less of your time within 6 months

---

## Interview Readiness (Anthropic / Google)
*If the Anthropic path opens up.*

- [ ] Can explain the agent loop without notes
- [ ] Have built 3+ agents with different architectures
- [ ] Can describe a multi-agent system you designed
- [ ] Have a production failure story and how you handled it
- [ ] Can articulate raw API vs. framework tradeoffs from experience

## The North Star Metric

> **Revenue per hour of JB's time.**

Every product decision, pricing decision, and build decision runs through this filter.
Skills, agents, and templates multiply this number. Hourly billing destroys it.
