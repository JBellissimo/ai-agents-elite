# Bellissimo AI Labs — Brand Style Guide
*Craft. Intelligence. Leverage.*

---

## Brand Essence

**What we are:**
A precision AI firm that builds intelligent systems for businesses that want to operate at a higher level. We are not a tech vendor. We are a trusted advisor that happens to deploy agents.

**The one-sentence brand:**
> "Bellissimo AI Labs builds the intelligence infrastructure that turns great businesses into exceptional ones."

**What we are NOT:**
- Not a chatbot company
- Not generic "AI consulting"
- Not hype-driven or trend-chasing
- Not enterprise-only or startup-only

**The personality:**
Think: a world-class sommelier who also knows how to build the restaurant's entire back-of-house system. Expert, warm, precise, unhurried. Confident without being arrogant. They've seen a thousand businesses — yours is interesting to them.

## Logo Concepts

*Professional logo design pending. These are starting directions.*

### Option A — Wordmark
`BELLISSIMO` in Cormorant Garamond, Letter-spaced, Navy
`AI LABS` in Inter 400, smaller, Gold
→ Clean, elegant, works at all sizes

### Option B — Monogram + Wordmark
`B` in a refined geometric shape (think: B inside a subtle hexagon or arc)
Navy fill, Gold accent stroke
`BELLISSIMO AI LABS` in Inter beneath

### Option C — The Lens Mark
A simple circular lens/aperture shape — suggesting "we see what others miss"
One half Navy, one half Gold gradient
Works as standalone icon for favicons, social avatars

### Logo Rules (until official logo exists)
- Use the wordmark: **BELLISSIMO AI LABS** in Cormorant Garamond
- Minimum size: 120px wide (don't shrink below legibility)
- Clear space: equal to the height of the "B" on all sides
- Never: stretch, rotate, change colors, add drop shadows, put on busy backgrounds

## Voice & Tone

### Brand Voice: "The Expert Friend"
Imagine the most knowledgeable person you know who has no interest in impressing you —
only in being genuinely useful. They're direct. They tell you the uncomfortable truth
politely but clearly. They know what you should do next and they tell you.

### Writing Principles

**Be specific, never vague**
- Wrong: "AI can help your business."
- Right: "We automate the 8 hours/week your team spends on status reports."

**Earn every word**
- No filler phrases: "cutting-edge," "best-in-class," "leverage synergies," "disruptive"
- If a sentence doesn't add information or move the reader, delete it

**Lead with the insight, not the technology**
- Wrong: "Our AI agents use Claude's API to analyze your business data."
- Right: "We tell you what your business looks like through an AI lens — including the things your spreadsheets aren't showing you."

**Confident, not arrogant**
- Wrong: "Nobody else does this."
- Right: "Most companies are running on tools built before AI existed. We fix that."

**Warm but not casual**
- Wrong: "Hey! Super excited to chat about your biz! 🚀"
- Right: "Let's talk about what you're building. There may be more opportunity here than you think."

### Tone by Context

| Context | Tone |
|---|---|
| Marketing copy | Confident, intriguing, premium |
| The Reveal report | Expert, precise, slightly warm |
| Sales conversation | Curious, direct, no pressure |
| Email outreach | Brief, specific, value-first |
| Agent/product UI | Clear, helpful, efficient |

## Visual Design Principles

**1. White space is not empty — it's intentional**
Premium brands use restraint. Don't fill every pixel. Let content breathe.

**2. Data should be beautiful**
When we show numbers, charts, or reports — they should look like something worth framing.
Think Bloomberg Terminal meets a Michelin-starred menu.

**3. Maps as art**
The city map visual is a signature asset. It says: we see your world with precision
you don't have access to. Use it deliberately — not decoratively.

**4. No stock photo people**
Never use generic smiling-people-at-computers stock photos.
Use: maps, data visualizations, architectural photography, abstract geometry.

**5. Asymmetry over symmetry**
Layouts should feel considered, not templated. Offset columns.
Headlines that don't center. Margin notes. Visual tension.
