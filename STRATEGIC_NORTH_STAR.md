## The North Star Metric

**Revenue per hour of JB's time.**

Every product, pricing, and build decision runs through this filter.
If it doesn't increase revenue per hour, it doesn't get built.

| Year | Target Rev/Hour | What Makes It Possible |
|------|----------------|------------------------|
| 2026 | $500/hr | First OS clients, Reveal pipeline live |
| 2027 | $2,000/hr | Company OS productized, SustainCFO systemized |
| 2028 | $5,000/hr | Flywheel licensing, agent-delivered work |
| 2030 | $10,000+/hr | Agents do 80% of delivery, JB does relationships |

---

## The Model

```
JB — Vision + Relationships + Sales (human-only work)
     ↓
BELLISSIMO AI LABS — Legal entity, brand, product delivery
     ↓
AGENTS + SKILLS — Execute at scale, 24/7/365
     ↓
CLIENTS — Pay for outcomes, not hours
```

**Two tracks. One intake.**

| SustainCFO Track | Bellissimo AI Labs Track |
|---|---|
| Fractional CFO retainer | Company OS build + retainer |
| $2,500–$7,500/mo | $5K–$15K build + $1K–$3K/mo |
| Financial visibility, cash flow, margins | Automation, intelligence, operating systems |
| ICP: $3–20M revenue, no FT CFO | ICP: Companies that outgrow manual operations |
| Current ARR: ~$1M | Current ARR: $0 — building now |

**Universal entry point:** The Bellissimo Scope/Reveal ($500)
→ 2-page intelligence report → over-deliver → convert to retainer

## Revenue Targets

| Year | SustainCFO ARR | Bellissimo ARR | Total ARR | Key Milestone |
|------|---------------|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2026 | $1.5M | $250K | $1.75M | First 5 Bellissimo clients. Reveal pipeline live. |
| 2027 | $2.5M | $1.5M | $4M | Company OS productized. First Flywheel workshop. |
| 2028 | $4M | $4M | $8M | Licensing model live. Inbound leads. |
| 2029 | $5M | $7M | $12M | Agent-delivered SustainCFO (50% time reduction). |
| 2030 | $6M | $14M | $20M | JB at 20hrs/week. Agents at 168hrs/week. |

**SustainCFO client math:**
- Current: ~12–15 clients
- 2026 target: 18–20 clients (add 4–6 net new)
- Average retainer: $6,250/mo → $75K/client/year
- 20 clients × $75K = $1.5M

**Bellissimo client math (2026):**
- Reveals: 30 run → 10 convert to paid engagement at $500 = $15K
- Company OS builds: 5 × $10K avg = $50K
- OS retainers: 5 × $2,000/mo → $120K ARR
- One-off builds: $65K
- Total: ~$250K

## The Pipeline Math

**107 marketing contacts (GHL) → SustainCFO:**
- 20% open rate → 21 opens
- 10% reply/click → 10–11 responses
- 30% discovery call close → 3–4 new calls
- 33% discovery-to-close → 1–2 new clients
- At $5,000/mo avg → $60–120K new ARR per outreach campaign
- Run 4 campaigns/year → $240–480K new ARR pipeline

**37 affiliates → SustainCFO:**
- Each refers 2 clients/year (conservative)
- 74 referrals → 30% close = 22 new clients
- At $5,000/mo → $1.32M new ARR per year (fully activated)
- This is the highest-LTV channel. Activate before anything else.

**Reveal → Retainer conversion target:**
- 40% of Reveal clients convert to a paid engagement
- 50% of paid engagements convert to retainer
- Net: 20% of Reveals → retainer client
- Run 30 Reveals → 6 new retainer clients

## The Strategy — Phase by Phase

### Phase 1 — Prove (Q1–Q2 2026) — NOW
**Goal:** First Bellissimo dollar. SustainCFO outreach live. Infrastructure done.

Critical path:
1. Josh approves Financial Clarity Assessment form → goes live
2. Affiliate activation email → 20+ affiliates engaged in 30 days
3. 107-contact GHL campaign → 3–4 discovery calls in 60 days
4. First Reveal delivered to a warm prospect
5. Ali Laith dental opportunity → re-engaged (7 days stale, $90K)

**Done when:** $250K combined ARR added. Reveal pipeline running.

### Phase 2 — Systemize (Q3–Q4 2026)
**Goal:** SustainCFO delivery automated. Company OS first client.

Critical path:
1. Monthly SustainCFO reporting → 80% agent-delivered
2. Company OS v1 built for 1 pilot client (SustainCFO referral)
3. Reveal intake form live on website
4. 20+ Reveals run → 4+ retainer conversions
5. Agent infrastructure → 3+ Discord commands serving real work

**Done when:** $1.75M combined ARR run rate. SustainCFO runs at 4hrs/client/month.

### Phase 3 — Productize (2027)
**Goal:** Company OS is a product, not a project. Flywheel workshop live.

Critical path:
1. OS playbook extracted from client 1 → templated
2. OS v2 delivered at 70% of first client cost
3. Flywheel workshop — first run ($2K–$5K, half-day)
4. Referral network → accountants, attorneys, brokers referring actively
5. LinkedIn content → 2+ inbound leads/month

**Done when:** $4M ARR. OS has 5+ clients. Flywheel case study exists.

## What We Are NOT Building

Constraints are strategy. These are off the table until Phase 3+:

- **No large headcount.** The model is JB + agents. First contractor hire only when revenue justifies AND the constraint is genuinely human.
- **No consumer products.** White-collar B2B only. $3–20M companies.
- **No custom dev work.** We build systems, not one-off code. If a client wants custom software, route to a partner.
- **No hourly billing.** Ever. Outcomes only.
- **No premature scaling.** Do not add new channels until existing channels are working.

---

## The Limiting Factor — Right Now (Feb 2026)

**The bottleneck is not technology. It is not strategy. It is sales pipeline.**

Everything else is infrastructure. The constraint today:
→ No Bellissimo clients yet
→ SustainCFO outreach not live
→ Ali Laith ($90K) going cold

The next dollar comes from: Josh conversation → form live → outreach live → discovery calls.
Agent capacity is not the bottleneck. Revenue activation is.
