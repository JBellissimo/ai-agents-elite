# Questions, Diagnostics, Talking Points, Demos

## The Core Pitch (30 seconds)

> "Most businesses are running on tools that were built before AI existed.
> We come in, understand how your business actually works, and build you
> an intelligent system that handles the work that's eating your best people's time.
> We call it your Company OS. You get more done with fewer people — and the system
> gets smarter every month."

**For the SustainCFO route:**
> "We give you a fractional CFO and an AI infrastructure at the same time.
> Financial visibility, automated reporting, and a system that flags problems
> before they become emergencies."

---

## The Routing Conversation
*Ask these 5 questions. Listen for the signals.*

### Q1 — The Financial Visibility Check
**"How clear is your financial picture right now — do you have someone managing
the numbers full-time, or is it more reactive?"**

| Answer | Route |
|---|---|
| "No CFO, things are messy" | **SustainCFO** |
| "We have an accountant but no strategy" | **SustainCFO** |
| "Finances are fine, operations are the issue" | **Bellissimo AI Labs** |

---

### Q2 — The Pain Locator
**"Where do you feel like you're leaving money on the table, or where is your
best time going that it probably shouldn't?"**

*Don't suggest answers. Let them talk. The first thing they say is the real problem.*

| Answer | Route |
|---|---|
| Cash flow, margins, pricing, banks | **SustainCFO** |
| Repetitive tasks, reports, follow-up, admin | **Bellissimo AI Labs** |
| "I don't know where my business stands" | **Bellissimo Reveal** (entry point) |

---

### Q3 — The AI Appetite Test
**"How much of your week is your team spending on things that feel like
they should be automated by now?"**

*This opens the AI conversation without pitching AI cold.
Let them identify the frustration themselves.*

- High frustration → **Bellissimo Labs** (automation, Company OS)
- Low frustration, financial focus → **SustainCFO**
- Curious but unsure → **"Let me show you something..."** → demo

---

### Q4 — The Budget Signal
**"If you could solve [the problem they named in Q2] permanently,
what would that be worth to you?"**

*Don't name a price first. Anchor to their value, not your cost.*

| Signal | Product |
|---|---|
| "$500–$2K" | The Bellissimo Reveal (entry product) |
| "$2K–$10K/mo" | Company OS or SustainCFO retainer |
| "$10K+" | Full OS build + ongoing retainer |

---

### Q5 — The Reveal Close
**"Here's what I'd like to do. I'll put together a 2-page intelligence report
on your business — powered by our AI, reviewed by me personally. It maps
your biggest risks and your biggest opportunities. It usually surfaces
2–3 things no one's talked about yet. Would that be useful?"**

*Almost everyone says yes. This is how you start every relationship.*

---

## The Demo: Show, Don't Tell
*"Let me show you what AI can do in 5 minutes."*

### Demo 1 — The Instant Summary (Most Accessible)
**Audience:** Any office worker, any industry
**Setup:** Open Claude. Paste a document they care about (a contract, email thread,
financial statement, employee review).
**Prompt:** "Summarize this, flag the 3 biggest risks, and suggest 3 action items."
**Impact:** They see their own document understood and synthesized in 10 seconds.
**Talking point:** "You just did what used to take 2 hours in 10 seconds."

---

### Demo 2 — The Business X-Ray (Highest Impact)
**Audience:** Business owner, CFO, CEO
**Setup:** Run agent.py on their business (or a similar demo company)
**Show:** The agent calling multiple tools, synthesizing data, producing a CFO-grade report
**Talking point:** "This used to require a full-time analyst. We run it on demand."

---

### Demo 3 — The Workflow Replacement (Most Relatable)
**Audience:** Operations, admin, middle management
**Setup:** Identify one workflow they do every week
**Common targets:**
- Weekly status report → "Give me a template, I'll show you how to generate this in 2 minutes"
- Meeting notes → "This AI listens, takes notes, and sends follow-ups"
- Customer follow-up emails → "Show me your last 5 follow-ups, I'll show you a better system"
**Talking point:** "Every person on your team has 10 hours/week that could be AI-assisted."

---

### Demo 4 — The Competitive Intelligence Hit
**Audience:** Sales, marketing, business development
**Setup:** "Give me a competitor's name."
**Show:** Claude summarizing their website, identifying their positioning, suggesting 3 differentiators
**Talking point:** "Your sales team could have this brief before every prospect call."

## The Simple Slide Deck (5 Slides)

### Slide 1 — The Headline
> **"Your business is generating more intelligence than you're using."**
> Bellissimo AI Labs builds the systems that turn that intelligence into action.

### Slide 2 — The Problem
> Most businesses run on: manual reporting, reactive decisions, and people doing work that AI should handle.
> Result: your best people are buried in admin.

### Slide 3 — The Solution
> We build your Company OS — a custom AI infrastructure that:
> - Runs your recurring reports automatically
> - Surfaces risks before they become problems
> - Prepares your team for every meeting, call, and decision
> - Gets smarter every month

### Slide 4 — The Products
| Product | What You Get | Investment |
|---|---|---|
| The Bellissimo Reveal | 2-page intelligence report on your business | $500 |
| Company OS | Full AI infrastructure, built for your company | $5K–$15K + retainer |
| The Flywheel | Agent system that learns + compounds | Custom |
| SustainCFO | Fractional CFO + AI financial visibility | $3K–$10K/mo |

### Slide 5 — The Ask
> **"Start with the Reveal."**
> 15-minute interview. 48-hour turnaround.
> We'll show you exactly what your business looks like through an AI lens.
> No obligation. Most clients find 2–3 things they hadn't considered.

---

## Objection Handling

**"We already use ChatGPT."**
> "That's great. What you're using is a general-purpose tool.
> What we build is a system that knows *your* business — your clients,
> your workflows, your language. There's a big difference between a tool
> and an operating system."

**"We're not sure we need AI yet."**
> "That's exactly why we start with the Reveal.
> Let the data tell you whether there's an opportunity. No commitment."

**"It sounds expensive."**
> "The question isn't the cost — it's the ROI.
> If we automate 10 hours/week of your team's time at $50/hr,
> that's $2,000/month. The system pays for itself in the first month."

**"We tried automation before and it didn't stick."**
> "What you tried was probably a point solution — one tool, one workflow.
> What we build is a system. Everything connects. That's why it sticks."
